The therapeutic landscape of lung cancer treatment is changing rapidly, and new data was presented at the recently concluded American Society of Clinical Oncology 2022 (ASCO22) meeting. We highlight studies of clinical relevance that represent significant updates in the current management of non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We summarize the updates in early-stage NSCLC, mutated and non-mutated advanced NSCLC as well as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and discuss these advances in the context of the current clinical standard of care.
